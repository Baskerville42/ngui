I just made this app for fun, 'cause I can. This app allows switching Node.jsÂ® versions with ease. That's all, Folks.

## Installation

- make sure that you have installed [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) with *npm* and [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) package globaly;
- visit [the app website]( https://baskerville42.github.io/ngui/) and click download;
- double click the downloaded zip file to extract;
- double clik on the extracted `.dmg`;
- drag `ngui.app` to the `Applications` folder;
- wait for the process to finish;
- eject the DMG (by clicking the eject button in the Sidebar).

## Usage
- open the app;
- you should see the Node version appear on the menu bar;
- click on the version and chose any installed Node version when needed;
- ðŸ¥³

To have the app always open.

- `System Preferences` > `Users & Groups`;
- select your User ID;
- select `Login Items`;
- click the `+` button to select `NGUI` app from your `Applications folder`.

## Roadmap
- refactor the code;
- allow installation/removal of Node.jsÂ® versions;
- show prompt with textbox to enter any Node.jsÂ® version manually;
- tweak UI;
